# 3) "How to" setup an STM32CubeIDE project mapping an external flash memory

##Advantages of Using Mapped Flash Memory
<br>
The use of a mapped Flash memory offers numerous advantages compared to directly managing SPI commands.<br>
<ul>


<li><b>Simplified Code Development</b>: The microcontroller accesses the memory as if it were internal, eliminating the need to implement complex communication protocols.</li>
<li><b>Improved Performance</b>: Performance can be significantly improved thanks to the ability to read data directly without repeatedly sending commands.</li>
<li><b>Transparent Memory Management</b>: The Flash can be treated as a native system resource, simplifying programs. Since the task of converting direct access into the sequence of SPI instructions is handled by dedicated hardware (QuadSPI devices), processor overhead is significantly reduced, freeing up more resources for other activities.</li>
<li><b>Scalability</b>: This approach is highly scalable, easily adapting to hardware project reorganizations (modifying the size and characteristics of the Flash<li><b> memory involved) and software adjustments (shifting data management from the microcontrollerâ€™s internal Flash to external memory).</li>
<ul>
